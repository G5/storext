## [2.2.2] - 2016-12-16
### Fixed

https://github.com/G5/storext-override/issues/8

## [2.2.1] - 2016-08-31
### Fixed

### Added

## [2.0.1] - 2016-05-26
### Fixed

### Changed
- Store the coerced values in the database. This may introduce a breaking change if one by-passes the reader method provided by `ActiveRecord::Store`. https://github.com/G5/storext/pull/17

### Fixed
- Do not blow up when `select` is used and the serialized column is not included https://github.com/G5/storext/issues/19

## [1.1.2]

- Refactor ClassMethods#store_attribute to call store_accessor only with the key to be added, instead of including existing keys.
